# Adaptive Portfolio Optimization

An adaptive portfolio optimization system that combines regime detection, deep learning, and modern portfolio theory to generate alpha-driven equity allocations. The model uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to identify market regimes from features including VIX term structure, S&P 500 momentum and volatility, and Treasury yield slopes. These regime probabilities are combined with fundamental equity features (valuation ratios, profitability metrics, growth rates) and technical indicators (momentum, volatility, market-relative performance) as inputs to a transformer neural network that predicts 20-day forward returns and volatility for individual stocks. The predicted returns and covariance matrix are then used in mean-variance optimization to construct optimal portfolio weights that maximize expected return for a given risk tolerance, enabling dynamic allocation that adapts to changing market conditions and individual security characteristics.
